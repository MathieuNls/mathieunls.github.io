  Hey there! I am working on many different projects and here are the ones I cherish the most !

## MindUp - Nearby anonymous instant messaging. Massive. Incoercible.

#### What is it ?

MindUp allows you to anonymously share your thoughts with people around you!
Speak your mind, choose how many persons you want to speak to, press send!
If nearby people like your mind, you'll earn points to send even more of them.

MindUp is great, because for the first time:

* You decide how many people you want to speak to.
* You are you sure that your messages will be read
* You will be estimated for what you say and not for who you are
* You can say what you really think, without worrying you about your reputation, your family, your friends, your work...
* You can exchange with an unlimited number of people who think like you... or not!

If you send your message to 50 people, the 50 people closest to your location will receive it without knowing from who it is!

Points are used when you choose the number of people you want to speak to. 1 point allows you to send your message to one person and if you're doing well, you can easily earn points and send messages to thousands of people!

#### What am I doing there ?

## Toolwatch - Measure your watch accuracy

<a id="toolwatch"></a>At Toolwatch we are crazy about mechanical watches. And when I say crazy, I mean nuts! As maniacs we want to know how accurate the watches we enjoy wearing really are and that's where we came up with Toolwatch. I used to measure the accuracy on a sticky note but had to do the maths every time and it wasn't the best for keeping track over time and I couldn't share it with other watch enthusiasts.

Our goal is to make this measure the most convenient possible and to share our passion for watchmaking. It's cool to see that with smartwatches (that really interest us by the way) also came a renewal of interest for mechanical watches too and that's really great !

#### What am I doing there ?

At [Toolwatch](https://toolwatch.io/), I'am co-founder and CTO. I am working with <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcAime">@MarcAime</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vsatiat">@vsatiat</a> to measure the accuracy of your mechanical watch in such a simple way that you'll actually use it.

## BUMPER

BUMPER (BUg Metarepository for dEvelopers and Researchers) is the cornerstone of my Ph.D thesis [@Concordia](https://twitter.com/Concordia).

In the last decade, the use of bug tracking tools have been adopted by both open-source and industry to take advantage of their various features. Bug tracking systems such as Bugzilla or Jira have grown to contain hundreds of thousands of bugs and provide crucial data to several active research fields such as bug reproduction, bug triaging, identification of duplicate bug, bug comprehension, and empirical studies. Easy access to the combined histories of all major open-source projects will save developers’ time and efforts when facing a bug or crash. The fixes to theses bugs, however, are contained in software versioning and revision systems and not in the bug tracking system. Furthermore, each software project comes with its own bug report and source versioning system. As a result, developers tend to reinvent the wheel intead of leveraging known solutions to similar problems.

<img style="padding:20px" src="/public/bumper.png" alt="bumper ShowRoom">

Currently, BUMPER contains more than 380 projects, 100,000 resolved/fixed and almost 70,000 changesets from Netbeans and the Apache Software foundation’s softwares. BUMPER is designed to be easily extensible to contain bugs and fixes from other bug and version control systems. 

#### What am I doing there ?

I am the creator of BUMPER and coordinate the work of research assistants and master students on it. Many, *many* things are currently being built on top of BUMPER, stay tuned...
